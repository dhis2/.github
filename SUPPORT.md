# DHIS2 Support

On the DHIS2 website there is [a section with relevant links](https://www.dhis2.org/learn) to
different resources for how to get help.

There is also the [Community of Practice](https://community.dhis2.org/). There are many experts in DHIS2 throughout the community so that is a very good resource to be aware of.

If you have any development-related questions, check the support channels on the [Developer Portal](https://developers.dhis2.org/community/support).

Finally, DHIS2 is reachable over e-mail at [post@dhis2.org](post@dhis2.org), use this as a last resort.
