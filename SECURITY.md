# DHIS2 Security Policy

The DHIS2 security team participates in responsible disclosure and welcomes collaboration with the wider community on security issues.

To report a security issue, please email security@dhis2.org with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

Please read our [Vulnerability Management and Disclosure Policy](https://dhis2.org/security/vulnerability-policy) before submitting a security issue, as some classes of vulnerabilities are explicitly out of scope.
