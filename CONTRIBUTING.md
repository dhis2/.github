# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for the decision to contribute to DHIS2! :heart:

To contribute to any of the DHIS2 repositories, please follow a few guidelines.

- Follow code standards
- Use semantic commit messages
- Follow contribution guidelines

We appreciate your contribution, and we will do our best to help you get it merged. If you have any questions, please reach out to us through the community channels, found at the [Developer Portal](https://developers.dhis2.org/community/support).

## Code standards

We have many repositories from different technological eras. A consequence of that is that it is difficult to speak
generally about how code standards we have.

Instead, we embed our code standards into our tools, so if your commit messages, code style, and more pass our checks
and balances, it is probably OK. If it is not, the maintainers will mention it in the code review.

## Semantic commit messages
Read more about this here: https://www.conventionalcommits.org

In short, use `git commit -m "feat: add new feature"` instead of `git commit -m "add new feature"` or `git commit -m "fix: add new feature"` instead of `git commit -m "fix add new feature"`.

## Contribution guidelines
Contribution guidelines can sometimes be found in the repository itself, but if not, you can find them here:

- https://developers.dhis2.org/community/contribute/
- https://developers.dhis2.org/community/contribute-dev-portal

In case there are any questions, please reach out through the community channels, found at the [Developer Portal](https://developers.dhis2.org/community/support).
