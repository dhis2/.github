# How to contribute

First of all, thanks for the decision to contribute to DHIS2! :heart:

## Code standards

We have many repositories from different technological eras. A consequence of that is that it is difficult to speak
generally about how code standards we have.

Instead, we embed our code standards into our tools, so if your commit messages, code style, and more pass our checks
and balances, it is probably OK. If it is not, the maintainers will mention it in the code review.
